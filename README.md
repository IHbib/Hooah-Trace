# Hooah Trace

a simple yet powerful instruction tracing using frida stalker - supporting arm64 and x64

## when you want to use this
when you need to trace at single instruction and perform additional operations or alter the code flow.

when you need to get a proper understanding of what's going on down there with obfuscations killing the party.

If installation of frida-onload fails then change package.json to the local directory of it #file:~/frida-onload

If build of example fails then change package.json of hooah-trace to local directory


### try it out
```$xslt
git clone https://github.com/IHbib/Hooah-Trace.git
cd Hooah-Trace
npm install
cd example
npm install


# make your edits to index.ts and att.py
python3 att.py
```

example code
```typescript
import {HooahTrace} from "hooah-trace";

function onHookInstruction(context: CpuContext, instruction: Instruction) {
    // console.log(JSON.stringify(context));
    // console.log(JSON.stringify(instruction));
    // console.log('');
}

const target = Module.findExportByName(null, 'open');
if (target) {
    Interceptor.attach(target, function () {
        HooahTrace.trace({
            // print the execution blocks
            printBlocks: true,

            // -1 is endless
            count: -1,

            // do not trace jumps in excluded modules (i.e libc / libSystem)
            filterModules: ['libc.so'],

            // you can trace specific instructions with
            // instructions: ['svc', 'ldr']

            // style block prints
            printOptions: {
                // yes please
                colored: true,

                // custom space between blocks
                treeSpaces: 8,

                // include involved register values data
                details: true
            }
        }, onHookInstruction);
    });
}
```
